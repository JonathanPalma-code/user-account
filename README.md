# Project Outline

## 👇 ./Overview 👇

This project is part of Jonathan Palma and the International History Students & Historians Group - IHSHG.

Our original goal was to build a website to protect the world of heritage and sharing/connecting between students and professionals in the fields of History, Archaeology, Speleology and Anthropology. As protection of heritage concern, we will continue to ensure the protection of the entire historical and cultural heritage of any part of the world. 

The project gives the possibility for any person to report a monument vicinity that is damaged, in bad condition or scheduled for destruction in real time!

After much consideration, we have decided to include the User and Post CRUD, so we have control and an identification of a certain report done by a certain user or to let the team know about an update of a report exposed using our post's option. 

As soon you join our cause, you will be redirect to the dashboard page where you will see all the posts made by the users and the nofications in real time, such as "Jonathan added a post" or "Joao joined our group".

## 👇 ./Approach 👇

Before building the project, we add to do research on which programming language, libraries, databases, APIs and techniques to develop the website. 

|Language | Runtime built | Libraries | Database |
|---------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| Javascript | Node.js | ReactJS and Redux | Firebase | 

Organisation of the project:
* Implement all components needed for the website - design of the website; 
* Add USER and POST CRUD using Firebase; 
* Attach a map and a announce form, so we can access the localisation and send the report to the heads of the team by email;
* Design Optimisation.

We focused on agile methodologies throughout the project. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
